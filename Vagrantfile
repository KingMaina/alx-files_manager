  # using a specific IP.

  #
  config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|

    # vb.gui = true
  
    # Customize the amount of memory on the VM:

  # View the documentation for the provider you are using for more
  # information on available options.

  # Ansible, Chef, Docker, Puppet and Salt are also available. Please see the
  # documentation for more information about their specific syntax and use.
